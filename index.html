                <h4>As a highly motivated individual, I have honed my skills as a versatile Programmer
                    and Designer. My proficiency in designing using Adobe Photoshop, Figma, and Adobe After Effects has
                    allowed me to create
                    captivating and visually stunning designs. My journey into the world of web and app development
                    began with a passion for
                    creating engaging user experiences. Through my determination and dedication, I pursued various
                    online courses and
                    leveraged resources such as FreeCodeCamp and YouTube to gain a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. With these
                    skills, I was able to successfully complete my first web project. As my expertise grew, I embraced
                    ReactJS as a
                    framework for developing complex and dynamic web applications. Additionally, I am currently honing
                    my skills in React
                    Native for mobile application development. Over the years, I have worked on a diverse range of
                    projects that showcase my
                    ability to deliver high-quality work and innovative solutions. I am passionate about staying
                    up-to-date with the latest
                    trends and technologies in my field and continuously seeking new opportunities to learn and grow as
                    a professional.</h4>
